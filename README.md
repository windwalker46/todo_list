To-Do List App
A command-line to-do list application in Python.

Features:
- Add tasks with priority and due dates.
- List, mark as done, or delete tasks.
- SQLite database integration for persistent storage.

Quick Start:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run: `python todo_list.py` (This will also initialize the database if it's the first run).
3. Follow on-screen prompts.

Troubleshooting:
- Ensure you have write permissions in the directory where the application is located to allow database initialization.
- If the database does not initialize automatically, create an empty file named `todo_list.db` in the project directory and run the application again.
